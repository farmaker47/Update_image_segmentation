# Image Segmentation Android sample.

This project is an effort to update the original segmentation android project that is demonstrated [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android). In this project CameraX is used instead of Camera2 class. You can find both implementations of CameraX inside the project, [ImageCapture](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/take-photo) where Bitmap is used for inference (master branch) and [ImageAnalysis](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/analyze) where media.Image (from CameraX's ImageProxy) is used for inference (ImageAnalysis branch).

The used model, DeepLab
[https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/semantic-image-segmentation-with.html] is a
state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal
is to assign semantic labels (e.g. person, dog, cat) to every pixel in the input
image.

### Switch between inference solutions (Task library vs TFLite Interpreter)

This image segmentation Android reference app demonstrates two implementation
solutions:

(1)
[`lib_task_api`](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android/lib_task_api)
that leverages the out-of-box API from the
[TensorFlow Lite Task Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/image_segmenter);

(2)
[`lib_interpreter`](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android/lib_interpreter)
that creates the custom inference pipleline using the
[TensorFlow Lite Interpreter Java API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference#load_and_run_a_model_in_java).

The [`build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) inside `app` folder shows how to change
`flavorDimensions "tfliteInference"` to switch between the two solutions.

Inside **Android Studio**, you can change the build variant to whichever one you
want to build and run â€” just go to `Build > Select Build Variant` and select one
from the drop-down menu. See
[configure product flavors in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors)
for more details.

To test the app, open the app called `TFL Image Segmentation` on your device.
Re-installing the app may require you to uninstall the previous installations.

For gradle CLI, running `./gradlew build` can create APKs for both solutions
under `app/build/outputs/apk`.

*Note: If you simply want the out-of-box API to run the app, we recommend
`lib_task_api` for inference. If you want to customize your own models and
control the detail of inputs and outputs, it might be easier to adapt your model
inputs and outputs by using `lib_interpreter`.*
